# Breast-Cancer-Dashboard-Analysis-Apex-Memorial-Hospital
This project presents a detailed visual analysis of breast cancer patient data from Apex Memorial Hospital. Using an interactive dashboard, we uncover key trends in tumor stages, surgical interventions, survival outcomes, and patient demographics.
## 🔍 Key Features:
1. Visualization of survival trends (Alive vs Dead) over time
2. Breakdown of surgical procedures (Lumpectomy, Modified Radical Mastectomy, etc.) by tumor stage
3. Gender and age group analysis to identify high-risk populations
4. Correlation between age and tumor stages
5. Monthly average age tracking to spot seasonal diagnosis patterns

## 🎯 Project Objectives:
1. Identify which patient groups are most affected by late-stage diagnosis
2. Evaluate the relationship between age, tumor stage, and survival
3. Support clinical decision-making through data visualization
4. Highlight disparities in diagnosis and treatment for targeted interventions

## ✅ Tools Used:
1. Excel
2. Pivot Table
3. Interactive Dashboards & Custom Visuals
